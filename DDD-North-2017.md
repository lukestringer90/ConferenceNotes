## The Power of Mentoring

**Simone Cuomo**

> Mentor - an experienced and trusted advisor

* Book - "Outliers: The Story of Success" by Malcom Gladwell.
* Mentoring is a two way process. This requires trust and someone willing to learn.
* Multiple mentors can support different skills.
* Reverse mentoring is where the mentoree is higher up the hierarchical scale. For example a engineer teaching a director about development or deployments.

> You can teach without wanting it, it's called "by example".

* Lead by example and inspire followers.
* Even great mentors have mentors themselves. Example - Mark Zuckerberg was mentored by Steve Jobs

> Entrepreneurs with mentors show that they are willing to learn, open to different perspective and adaptable to change.

* Accepting weakness is a strength of it's own.
* A cycle:
	* Identify weakness
	* Learn
	* Teach *(Do you know something enough to actually teach others?)*
	* Repeat

> Imposter syndrome: Scared of not knowing enough and being found out as a fraud.

* 1/3 people suffer from imposter syndrome.
* More women affected than men.
* If you mentor someone you get a trusted a advisor.
* Juniors don't know what they don't know. Therefore the cannot know the boundaries of their knowledge.
* Rather than rating a skill from 1-10 try this scale
	1. Fix
	2. Create
	3. Improve
	4. Teach
* Just like Software Craftsmanship, we should usher in Mentor Craftsmanship by
	* Leading by example
	* Curing imposter syndrome
	* Accepting your weaknesses
	* Inspiring others
* Prepare for 1-2-1s.
* Try to create circumstance for others to showcase their strengths. Let them "be the hero".


## Spot the Different. Automating Visual Regression Testing

**Viv Richards**

* Only automate common things as it requires investment.
* Fail fast for quick feedback and then adapt to change.
* Appium works with selenium to drive iOS and Android, both simulator/emulator and real devices.
* Idea: limit WIP to less than the full team to force team members across different disciplines to work together.


## Scaling Agile in your Organisation with the Spotify Model

**Stephen Haunts**

* Book- "A Gentle Introduction to Agile"
* Growing rapidly results in growing pains.
* Must manage this growth carefully.
* Problems:
	* Divided by discipline.
	* Seating plan by function.
	* These do not support growth.
* Video: "Spotify Engineering Culture"
* Make Agile things optional, but keep the spirit
	* Agile > Scrum
	* Servant > Master
* A Tribe is made of Squads
* Self organising, autonomous and empowered.
* Leaders decide the "Why"
* Squad decides the "What" and "How"
* Loosely coupled but tightly aligned squads.
* No competition between squads.
* Hire for cultural fit first, skills second.
* Keep the same line manager even if you move squad.
* Guilds for particular areas of interest. Slack channels for each.
* Encourage innovations with hackathons.
	* Centred on customers.
	* Cross functional.
	* Start from scratch.
	* Focused on the output.
	* Iterative and continuous.
* Community over formal structures.
* Embrace failure early, and learn from mistakes.
* "Launch Darkly" for feature flags.
* Spotify model does suit monolithic applications, so move away from this.
* Remember, this is not a silver bullet.
* Must have management buy in.
* Customers in insurance industry gave fixed dates and budgets. Agile team had to work backwards from this.
* Works well for start-ups and companies of less than 100 employees.
* You should adapt the Spotify model to your business. 
* Needs wholesale adoption by the entire company.
* Encourage a learning culture.
